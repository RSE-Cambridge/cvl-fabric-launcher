# Adapted from C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\py2exe\samples\simple\setup.py

# Run the build process by running
#
# 'python create_windows_bundle.py py2exe' in a console prompt.
#
# This script would traditionally be named 'setup.py'.
#
# If everything works well, you should find a subdirectory named 'dist'
# containing some files, including an exe file and some DLLs.
