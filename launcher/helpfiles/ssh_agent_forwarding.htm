<dt><b>SSH Agent</b></dt>
<dd>A persistent process which is run to ensure that your private key is always with you wherever you need it, and to ensure that you don't need to re-enter your private key's passphrase except when really necessary.  The SSH Agent runs on your local machine and loads your private key into memory, so that it will be accessible with "ssh-add -l".  Then, by SSHing to a remote server with the "-A" option, you can spawn another ssh-agent process on the remote server, which will also be authorized to use your private key for connections to subsequent servers, without having to copy the private key file from your local machine to any of the remote servers.</dd>
