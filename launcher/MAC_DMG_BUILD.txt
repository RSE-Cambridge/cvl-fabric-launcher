The MASSIVE Launcher.dmg disk image can be created using the method described 
here: 

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/96882/how-do-i-create-a-nice-looking-dmg-for-mac-os-x-using-command-line-tools

The exact steps used are shown below.

This assumes that the MASSIVE Launcher.app bundle has been copied to a separate
folder, called "dmg", to distinguish it from the "dist" folder which may contain
additional files, which are not required in the disk image.

The dmgBackgroundMacOSX.png image file provides the background image for the disk image,
which displays an arrow, telling the user to drag the MASSIVE Launcher.app 
bundle into (a symbolic link to) their Applications folder.

mkdir ~/Desktop/dmg/
mv dist/MASSIVE\ Launcher.app/ ~/Desktop/dmg/
cd ~/Desktop/
