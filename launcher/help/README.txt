The Launcher will try to download its help content from a remote server, e.g.

https://raw.github.com/CVL-dev/cvl-fabric-launcher/master/help/helpfiles.zip

so that the content can be updated without having to release a new version.

If the Launcher fails to download up-to-date help content, then it will
display content bundled with the Launcher distribution which was 
up-to-date at the time of that Launcher release.
