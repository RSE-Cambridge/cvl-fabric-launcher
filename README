MASSIVE/CVL LAUNCHER
====================

MASSIVE Desktop: https://www.massive.org.au/userguide/cluster-instructions/using-the-massive-desktop

CVL: https://www.nectar.org.au/characterisation-virtual-laboratory

MASSIVE/CVL Launcher is an attempt to offer MASSIVE/CVL users an easier login 
method, beginning with Mac OS X users.  Until TurboVNC v1.2, Mac OS X users had
to install TurboVNC, only to find that there was no double-clickable TurboVNC 
application in their Applications folder, so they had to run TurboVNC from the 
command-line after creating an SSH tunnel.  MASSIVE/CVL Launcher provides a 
double-clickable GUI launcher for MASSIVE users, which creates the SSH tunnel 
automatically, and then calls TurboVNC to launch the MASSIVE/CVL Desktop.  This
allows the user to launch the MASSIVE/CVL Desktop without having to use the 
command-line.

MASSIVE/CVL LAUNCHER CONFLUENCE DOCUMENTATION AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

https://confluence-vre.its.monash.edu.au/display/CVL/MASSIVE+Launcher+%28wxPython+client-side+GUI%29

PYTHON VERSION

A 32-bit version of Python is required to use wxPython. It is best to install
Python from python.org, rather than trying to use a pre-installed version
bundled with the operating system. James uses python-2.7.3-macosx10.3.dmg from 
Python.org.

WXPYTHON VERSION

The wxPython version you use must match the Python version being used 
(e.g. 2.7).  James uses wxPython2.8-osx-unicode-2.8.12.1-universal-py2.7 from 
http://wxpython.org/download.php 

ICON

The MASSIVE.icns icon file is for the Mac OS X operating system only. 
It was created using the free Img2icns application. http://www.img2icnsapp.com/
There is also a built-in Mac OS X application, Icon Composer. It used to live
in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder, or the /Developer/Applications/ folder.
Now you have to install Xcode first (from the App Store), then launch Xcode, 
and from the Xcode menu, choose "Open Developer Tool". The image used to create
the icon was taken as a screenshot (cmd-shift-4) from the MASSIVE website. The
white background was then made transparent, by using Gimp 2.8's 
"Color to Alpha..." menu item in the "Colors" menu. 

The create_mac_bundle.py script can be used to specify the icon file
(MASSIVE.icns), which will be included in MASSIVE.app/Contents/Info.plist by
the py2app module. The MASSIVE.icns file will be copied into
MASSIVE.app/Contents/Resources/ by the py2app module.

wxPython provides a handy tool (/usr/local/bin/img2py) for encoding a bitmap 
image (e.g. an icon) in a platform-independent Python script.  A Python version
of the MASSIVE icon has been created as MASSIVE_icon.py
